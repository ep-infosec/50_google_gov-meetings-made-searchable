### Introduction

This is a container that receives pubsub messages with `globalId` identifiers and then
kicks off a workflow to lookup the video associated with that identifier, download the
corresponding video from Google Cloud Storage, transcode that video to audio in a FLAC
format, then upload the audio segments to Google Cloud Storage.


### Assumptions

* You have created a Pubsub topic called `transcodeQueue`
* You have created a Pubsub subscription called `media-transcode-subscription`
* You have deployed a utility service to handle database lookups and updates

### Build and Run this container

Build
`docker build -t transcode-video-to-audio:latest .`

Run
`docker run -it transcode-video-to-audio`
